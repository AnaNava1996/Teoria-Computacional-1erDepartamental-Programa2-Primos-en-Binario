# Teoria-Computacional-1erDepartamental-Programa2-Primos-en-Binario
In the ''Primos en binario'' program, you chose a number and get all the prime numbers before it in decimal and binary numeral system... In the ''ocurrencias para grafico excel'', is just the number of appearances of 1 or 0 before a binary number, for 5 for example we have 0,1,10,11,100,101, so there are 5 zeros and 7 ones, the program makes a txt file so you can copy to an excel and make a chart

PS: don't worry when ''ocurrencias para grafico excel.cpp'' runs like crazy, it'll stop before reaching 1000(decimal)
